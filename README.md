- [Usage](#usage)
- [Example][example]
- [Complete Demo App](demo_app/lib/main.dart)
- [Handle Redirection](#handle-redirection-optional) (Optional)

| Please refer our official flutter documentation [here](https://docs.atoa.me/).

## Installation

Run following to add Atoa SDK to your flutter project

```sh
flutter pub add atoa_flutter_sdk
```

## Usage

Sample code to integrate can be found in [demo_app\lib\widgets\pay_now_bottom_sheet.dart](demo_app\lib\widgets\pay_now_bottom_sheet.dart).

#### Import package

```dart
import 'package:atoa_flutter_sdk/atoa_flutter_sdk.dart';
```

#### Show Payment Sheet

It's a full screen sheet which shows all the available bank list then once user selects the bank. They will be redirected to their bank app or website.

```dart
final paymentDetails = AtoaSdk.pay(
      context,
      paymentId: 'your-payment-request-id',
      showHowPaymentWorks: false,
      customerDetails: const CustomerDetails(
        phoneCountryCode: '44',
        phoneNumber: '8788899999',
        email: 'aaa@gmail.com',
      ),
      env: AtoaEnv.prod,
      // or AtoaEnv.sandbox

      onUserClose: (paymentRequestId) {
        // handle payment when user close the payment verification bottom sheet

         ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(
            backgroundColor: RegalColors.darkOrange,
            content: Text(
             'User closed the payment for paymentRequestId: $paymentRequestId',
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
      onPaymentStatusChange: (status) {
        // handle payment status
         print('Payment Status Changed to $status');
      },
      onError: (error) {
        // handle Atoa Mobile SDK error
         print('Error in Atoa Mobile SDK ${error.message}');
      },
    );
```

### Customer Details for Previously Used Banks

The SDK supports displaying banks the customer has previously paid with through the `customerDetails` parameter:

#### Important Notes About Customer Details

- **Uniqueness**: The `customerDetails` should be a unique identifier for each customer in your system.
- **Persistence**: When a customer completes a payment, the bank they used is remembered and associated with this customerDetails.
- **Returning Customers**: For returning customers, providing the same `customerDetails` allows the SDK to offer the option to pay with banks they've previously used.
- **Security**: The information about previously used banks is securely stored by Atoa, not in your application.
- **Optional**: This parameter is optional. If not provided, each payment will be treated as a new transaction without showing previously used banks.

#### Best Practices

- Use a consistent and unique identifier from your system (e.g., user ID, customer reference).
- Keep the same `customerDetails` across all payments for the same customer to ensure continuity of previously used banks.
- Consider user consent and data privacy regulations when implementing this functionality.
